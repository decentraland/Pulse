# Pulse
.NET-based authoritative server for fulminant social interactions

## Protocol generation

Protocol is auto-generated from the "protocol" directory, from "common" and "pulse" subdirs.

It should reside on the same level as the root of the repo. You can modify `Directory.Build.props` to point to another location.

The protocol branch should start off from "quantization" branch https://github.com/decentraland/protocol/tree/quantization.
