///     Reliable packets on a channel block sequenced unreliable packets on the same channel.

///     Unreliable packets are still discarded if a newer sequence number has already been received — that's fine and expected.
///     But if a reliable packet is in-flight and unacknowledged, ENet will hold back subsequent sequenced unreliable packets on that same channel until the reliable one is ACK'd. This is head-of-line blocking — exactly what you're trying to avoid for position updates.
///     Unsequenced packets are immune to this — they bypass the sequence tracking entirely and will go through regardless of pending reliable packets on the channel.
